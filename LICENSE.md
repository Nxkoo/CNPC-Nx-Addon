**All Rights Reserved, unless otherwise explicitly stated**

### **Exclusion of Third-Party Intellectual Property**

Intellectual property associated with the name and features of **Geckolib**, developed by Bernie-G, and **CustomNPC+**,
developed by kamkeel, is not covered by this license. The use of Geckolib, CustomNPC+, and their assets must comply with
the specific terms provided by their respective authors. This license applies exclusively to the intellectual property
and content developed by Nykoo and João Alberis related to NxLib and CNPC-Nx-Addon.

### **Private Use**

Private use cases are not subject to this license. This includes personal use of the libraries, private modpacks, or
customizations through configuration files or direct editing of contents, as long as the projects or associated media
are not shared publicly. Any use of NxLib or CNPC-Nx-Addon intellectual property that is distributed or made available
to the public (via downloads, screenshots, videos, etc.) must comply with the terms of this license.

---

### **Credit Restrictions**

All use of NxLib and CNPC-Nx-Addon intellectual property must credit the original projects by name ("NxLib" and "
CNPC-Nx-Addon") and provide links or references to the official project pages on GitHub:

### **Non-Compete**

Projects utilizing ideas, code, or assets from NxLib or CNPC-Nx-Addon may not directly compete with the original
libraries. A project is considered to be in competition if it offers features or interactive content similar to those
offered by NxLib or CNPC-Nx-Addon. Modpacks are exempt from this restriction, provided they include a significant amount
of content to justify the redistribution of NxLib or CNPC-Nx-Addon files.
