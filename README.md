- **NxLib Integration**: Leverages NxLib's animation framework to support advanced, customizable animations.
- **Geckolib Animation System**: Smooth animations for both first-person and third-person perspectives.
- **CustomNPC+ Compatibility**: Adds enhanced animation features to CustomNPC+ for dynamic scripting and gameplay.
- **Player-Specific Animations**: Control animations on a per-player basis for more immersive interactions.

    - **NxLib** (required library).

2. **Installation Steps**:
    - Download the latest release of CNPC-Nx-Addon from the [Releases](https://github.com/nxkoo/CNPC-Nx-Addon/releases) page.
    - Place the `.jar` file in the `mods` folder of your Minecraft instance.
    - Ensure that all dependencies are also installed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

This add-on introduces several new methods and functionalities for CustomNPC+ scripting. Below is an example of what the mod enables:

### Mixin Class

The core functionality is implemented through mixins for the `PlayerWrapper` class. Here's an overview of key methods available:

#### Methods:

- **`NxAnimation registerAnimation(String animationName, int duration, boolean separateLeftAndRight, boolean lockHeldItemMainHand, String loopType)`**
    - Registers a new animation for a player.
    - The loop types are: ‚Äúplay_once‚Äù, ‚Äúhold_on_last_frame‚Äù, ‚Äúloop‚Äù

- **`void startAnimation(NxAnimation animation)`**
    - Starts a specific animation for the player.

- **`void stopAnimation()`**
    - Stops the current animation for the player.

- **`List<Animation> getFirstPersonAnimations()`**
    - Retrieves a list of all first-person animations.

- **`List<Animation> getThirdPersonAnimations()`**
    - Retrieves a list of all third-person animations.

- **`List<Animation> getAllAnimations()`**
    - Retrieves a combined list of all animations.

## ‚ú® Example Code

Here is an example of how to use the add-on in a CustomNPC+ script:

```javascript
var playerWrapper = npc.player; // Get the player wrapper
var demoAnimation = "demo";

// Register a new animation
var animation = playerWrapper.registerAnimation(demoAnimation, 10, false, false, "LOOP");

// Start the animation
playerWrapper.startAnimation(animation);

// Stop the animation
playerWrapper.stopAnimation();
```

This add-on simplifies the process of adding dynamic animations for scripted NPC interactions.
